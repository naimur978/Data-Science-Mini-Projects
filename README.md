# Data-Science-Mini-Projects

Welcome to my data science repository! Here, I've shared three mini-projects that I completed as part of a data science course. Each project explores different aspects of data analysis and visualization.

1. Network Analysis
In the "Network Analysis" project, I delve into the analysis of networks and their connections, examining complex interconnected graphs. This project explores the relationships within networks, shedding light on the structure and patterns present in the data.

2. Scrape Websites
The "Scrape Websites" project focuses on web scraping techniques applied to three distinct flight websites. The goal was to gather data according to specific requirements, providing insights into web scraping practices and data collection.

3. Students Performance
"Students Performance" is centered around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of students' scores from previous iterations of this course. The project investigates patterns and trends in student performance data, offering valuable insights for educational assessment and improvement.
