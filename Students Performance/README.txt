Except this txt file, I am sharing 3 more files here -

1. Mini_Project_2.ipynb
2. MP2_Data.csv
3. Scientific Report


Regrading the ipynb file, after opening it on colab, kaggle, or any notebook, you need to press "Runtime" -> "Run all". Then you need to upload the MP2_Data.csv file in the first cell. Voila!


If you find any issue, or need to contact me, here is my email - naimur.rahman@abo.fi.
